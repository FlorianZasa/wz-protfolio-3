        shortDescription: "During my study I made an internship where I worked on the redesign of the Mediajungle website.",
        introduction: "During my internship at Klare Koek, a communication agency based in Leeuwarden specializing in serious games, I was tasked with redesigning their existing Mediajungle website. Mediajungle aims to facilitate dialogue between educators, adults, youths, and children about online media use and behavior. Originally designed for a single product, the Mediajungle board game, the website had become outdated and cluttered as new tools and services were added. My primary objective was to create a more accessible, intuitive, and visually appealing website that effectively communicates Mediajungle’s expanded offerings and mission",
        problemOverview: "The old Mediajungle website faced several critical issues that hindered its effectiveness. First, the design was outdated, making it visually unappealing and less engaging for modern users. The site was originally built in 2017 to support the launch of the Mediajungle board game, but as the company expanded its range of products and services, the website failed to evolve with it. This led to a cluttered and disorganized presentation of content, with new offerings being added without a clear structure.\n\nThe poor navigation further exacerbated the problem. Users struggled to find relevant information quickly, as the site lacked a logical, user-friendly layout. Important sections were buried under confusing menus or too many clicks, and the lack of clear calls to action made it difficult for visitors to understand Mediajungle's full product range, including its educational tools and serious games. This lack of clarity and accessibility not only frustrated users but also limited Mediajungle’s ability to convert visitors into customers, ultimately affecting both customer retention and the company's growth.",
        designProcess: "To begin the design process, I conducted extensive research to analyze the existing website and identify the core issues. While it was important to keep the client's wishes in mind, the primary focus was always on user needs. Therefore, my first step was to gather insights through interviews and usability tests on the old website. This approach helped me gain a deeper understanding of user behaviors and pain points, which would later guide the redesign.\n\nThe key task was to make the website more intuitive and to better reflect the core message of Mediajungle. I frequently spoke with students and professors familiar with LVB (mild intellectual disabilities) to understand the needs of users who had no prior knowledge of Mediajungle. This research allowed me to identify the necessary information and design elements that would help users trust and engage with the tools offered by Mediajungle.\n\nThe first 2 months, I focused primarily  on conducting research and user experience. I created wireframes and interactive prototypes to ensure that the user experience would be smooth and logical. Regular testing of these prototypes helped me iterate and refine the design based on user feedback.",
        result: "The redesigned Mediajungle website introduced several key improvements that directly addressed the issues identified during the research phase. One of the most significant changes was the overhaul of the website's structure and navigation. I streamlined the layout to ensure that users could easily find relevant information, reducing the number of clicks needed to reach important sections. The new, intuitive navigation menu groups content logically, making it simple for users—especially those unfamiliar with Mediajungle’s products—to explore the site and understand what it offers.\n\nVisually, the website now features a modern, clean interface that aligns with Mediajungle’s branding and provides a more professional, engaging look. I implemented a minimalistic design with a focus on readability and accessibility, using a consistent color palette and typography that enhances the user experience. The updated layout makes better use of space, allowing key messages and product information to stand out without overwhelming the user.\n\nOverall, the redesigned website is not only more visually appealing but also significantly more user-friendly. Users can now navigate the site effortlessly, find the information they need faster, and engage with Mediajungle’s content in a more intuitive way. The improvements have helped support Mediajungle’s mission to make education and learning more enjoyable and accessible through serious games, with both clients and internal stakeholders expressing satisfaction with the final product.",

        subtitle: "Concept",
        shortDescription: "MARK is a conceptual web-design project focused on creating a modern platform for paid online surveys.",
        introduction: "The MARK project was a concept I developed as part of a design challenge during a job interview process. Given just two days to redesign an existing website that offered paid online surveys, the goal was to deliver a modern, visually appealing, and highly functional site that would improve both user experience and brand appeal. This project tested my ability to work under pressure, quickly generate ideas, and deliver a comprehensive design solution, complete with custom graphics and icons. Although the company ultimately did not use my design, this project demonstrates my ability to work on tight deadlines and create polished, professional results. To maintain discretion, I’ve renamed the project to MARK for my portfolio.",
        problemOverview: "The original website I was tasked with redesigning had several key issues that needed to be addressed. It had an outdated layout, lacked visual hierarchy, and struggled to engage users effectively. The website’s primary function was to inform users about paid online surveys and convert visitors into participants, but its cluttered design and poor use of negative space made navigation difficult. Important information, such as survey details and sign-up instructions, was not easily accessible, leading to user frustration. Additionally, the visual style did not reflect a modern, professional brand image, which could deter potential users from trusting the service. The challenge was to overhaul the design, improve usability, and create a fresh, appealing look that would attract users while maintaining a professional tone.",
        designProcess: "Given the time constraints of this challenge, I began the design process by thoroughly analyzing the original website’s weaknesses, focusing on user experience and visual presentation. My first step was to create a simplified layout that would allow users to navigate the site with ease. I introduced more negative space to reduce clutter and make key information stand out, such as the sign-up process and survey offerings.\n\nAfter sketching initial wireframes, I moved on to creating a clean, modern interface with a focus on readability and user engagement. I selected a blue and orange color scheme, balancing professionalism with energy and approachability, while ensuring strong visual contrast for accessibility. I also designed custom icons and graphics to match the overall aesthetic and enhance the user journey. Throughout the process, I prioritized intuitive navigation, ensuring that users could easily understand how to register, find surveys, and participate without confusion.",
        result: "The final result of the MARK redesign was a sleek, modern website concept that effectively addressed the usability and visual challenges of the original design. By incorporating a minimalist layout with ample negative space, I was able to create a clean, easy-to-navigate interface that guides users smoothly through the site. The blue and orange color palette, paired with custom-designed icons and graphics, brought a fresh, contemporary feel that aligned with the goals of attracting and engaging users interested in online surveys.\n\nAlthough the design was not ultimately implemented by the company, the project succeeded in demonstrating my ability to deliver high-quality, professional work within a short timeframe. The improved layout, modern design, and intuitive navigation structure reflect my strengths in user experience design and my ability to create visually compelling digital products. MARK stands as a strong example of my problem-solving skills, creativity, and capacity to work efficiently under pressure.",
