        shortDescription: "During my study I made an internship where I worked on the redesign of the Mediajungle website.",
        introduction: "During my internship at Klare Koek, a communication agency based in Leeuwarden specializing in serious games, I was tasked with redesigning their existing Mediajungle website. Mediajungle aims to facilitate dialogue between educators, adults, youths, and children about online media use and behavior. Originally designed for a single product, the Mediajungle board game, the website had become outdated and cluttered as new tools and services were added. My primary objective was to create a more accessible, intuitive, and visually appealing website that effectively communicates Mediajungle’s expanded offerings and mission",
        problemOverview: "The old Mediajungle website faced several critical issues that hindered its effectiveness. First, the design was outdated, making it visually unappealing and less engaging for modern users. The site was originally built in 2017 to support the launch of the Mediajungle board game, but as the company expanded its range of products and services, the website failed to evolve with it. This led to a cluttered and disorganized presentation of content, with new offerings being added without a clear structure.\n\nThe poor navigation further exacerbated the problem. Users struggled to find relevant information quickly, as the site lacked a logical, user-friendly layout. Important sections were buried under confusing menus or too many clicks, and the lack of clear calls to action made it difficult for visitors to understand Mediajungle's full product range, including its educational tools and serious games. This lack of clarity and accessibility not only frustrated users but also limited Mediajungle’s ability to convert visitors into customers, ultimately affecting both customer retention and the company's growth.",
        designProcess: "To begin the design process, I conducted extensive research to analyze the existing website and identify the core issues. While it was important to keep the client's wishes in mind, the primary focus was always on user needs. Therefore, my first step was to gather insights through interviews and usability tests on the old website. This approach helped me gain a deeper understanding of user behaviors and pain points, which would later guide the redesign.\n\nThe key task was to make the website more intuitive and to better reflect the core message of Mediajungle. I frequently spoke with students and professors familiar with LVB (mild intellectual disabilities) to understand the needs of users who had no prior knowledge of Mediajungle. This research allowed me to identify the necessary information and design elements that would help users trust and engage with the tools offered by Mediajungle.\n\nThe first 2 months, I focused primarily  on conducting research and user experience. I created wireframes and interactive prototypes to ensure that the user experience would be smooth and logical. Regular testing of these prototypes helped me iterate and refine the design based on user feedback.",
        result: "The redesigned Mediajungle website introduced several key improvements that directly addressed the issues identified during the research phase. One of the most significant changes was the overhaul of the website's structure and navigation. I streamlined the layout to ensure that users could easily find relevant information, reducing the number of clicks needed to reach important sections. The new, intuitive navigation menu groups content logically, making it simple for users—especially those unfamiliar with Mediajungle’s products—to explore the site and understand what it offers.\n\nVisually, the website now features a modern, clean interface that aligns with Mediajungle’s branding and provides a more professional, engaging look. I implemented a minimalistic design with a focus on readability and accessibility, using a consistent color palette and typography that enhances the user experience. The updated layout makes better use of space, allowing key messages and product information to stand out without overwhelming the user.\n\nOverall, the redesigned website is not only more visually appealing but also significantly more user-friendly. Users can now navigate the site effortlessly, find the information they need faster, and engage with Mediajungle’s content in a more intuitive way. The improvements have helped support Mediajungle’s mission to make education and learning more enjoyable and accessible through serious games, with both clients and internal stakeholders expressing satisfaction with the final product.",

        subtitle: "Concept",
        shortDescription: "MARK is a conceptual web-design project focused on creating a modern platform for paid online surveys.",
        introduction: "The MARK project was a concept I developed as part of a design challenge during a job interview process. Given just two days to redesign an existing website that offered paid online surveys, the goal was to deliver a modern, visually appealing, and highly functional site that would improve both user experience and brand appeal. This project tested my ability to work under pressure, quickly generate ideas, and deliver a comprehensive design solution, complete with custom graphics and icons. Although the company ultimately did not use my design, this project demonstrates my ability to work on tight deadlines and create polished, professional results. To maintain discretion, I’ve renamed the project to MARK for my portfolio.",
        problemOverview: "The original website I was tasked with redesigning had several key issues that needed to be addressed. It had an outdated layout, lacked visual hierarchy, and struggled to engage users effectively. The website’s primary function was to inform users about paid online surveys and convert visitors into participants, but its cluttered design and poor use of negative space made navigation difficult. Important information, such as survey details and sign-up instructions, was not easily accessible, leading to user frustration. Additionally, the visual style did not reflect a modern, professional brand image, which could deter potential users from trusting the service. The challenge was to overhaul the design, improve usability, and create a fresh, appealing look that would attract users while maintaining a professional tone.",
        designProcess: "Given the time constraints of this challenge, I began the design process by thoroughly analyzing the original website’s weaknesses, focusing on user experience and visual presentation. My first step was to create a simplified layout that would allow users to navigate the site with ease. I introduced more negative space to reduce clutter and make key information stand out, such as the sign-up process and survey offerings.\n\nAfter sketching initial wireframes, I moved on to creating a clean, modern interface with a focus on readability and user engagement. I selected a blue and orange color scheme, balancing professionalism with energy and approachability, while ensuring strong visual contrast for accessibility. I also designed custom icons and graphics to match the overall aesthetic and enhance the user journey. Throughout the process, I prioritized intuitive navigation, ensuring that users could easily understand how to register, find surveys, and participate without confusion.",
        result: "The final result of the MARK redesign was a sleek, modern website concept that effectively addressed the usability and visual challenges of the original design. By incorporating a minimalist layout with ample negative space, I was able to create a clean, easy-to-navigate interface that guides users smoothly through the site. The blue and orange color palette, paired with custom-designed icons and graphics, brought a fresh, contemporary feel that aligned with the goals of attracting and engaging users interested in online surveys.\n\nAlthough the design was not ultimately implemented by the company, the project succeeded in demonstrating my ability to deliver high-quality, professional work within a short timeframe. The improved layout, modern design, and intuitive navigation structure reflect my strengths in user experience design and my ability to create visually compelling digital products. MARK stands as a strong example of my problem-solving skills, creativity, and capacity to work efficiently under pressure.",

        title: "Quizzy",
        subtitle: "",
        shortDescription: "Quizzy is an interactive platform created to enhance communication and teamwork among students through game-based learning.",
        introduction: "For my thesis project as part of my study, I chose to focus on addressing the challenges faced by students in the Internationale Schakelklas (ISK), which translates to International Transition Class. This is a type of school in the Netherlands designed to help students who do not yet speak Dutch, particularly young refugees, integrate into the Dutch educational system. Drawing from my personal experience as a former ISK student, I understood firsthand how difficult it can be to feel included in a group when language is a barrier. This led me to develop a tool aimed at improving communication, group dynamics, and the use of the Dutch language within these classes. Through my research and design, I sought to create a solution that fosters teamwork and inclusivity, helping students overcome language challenges while building social connections.",
        designProcess: "To tackle this issue, I began by researching different group dynamics and communication challenges in multicultural classrooms. I analyzed how students currently interact, focusing on how language barriers and cultural differences affected teamwork. This research informed the creation of 'Quizzy', a gamified learning tool designed to engage students in team-building activities while encouraging students to communicate in Dutch.\n\nThe design process involved developing an interactive platform that integrates quizzes and game cards. The quizzes encourage students to work together in Dutch, while the game cards introduce playful challenges to enhance communication. Gamification elements like points, rewards, and role-playing were included to motivate students to participate actively. I worked closely with teachers and UX experts to refine the design, ensuring it was both fun and educational. Regular feedback from ISK educators helped me iterate on the design, making sure it addressed the needs of both students and teachers. Additionally, I conducted usability testing to ensure that the platform was intuitive and accessible for the teachers who use the platform during the game.\n\nAn important part of Quizzy’s design is the role of the teacher, or Quizzymaster, who moderates the game. The Quizzymaster ensures that students work together, supporting their progression through different stages of team-building while maintaining a balanced and inclusive classroom dynamic.",
        problemOverview: "Many ISK students experience difficulties beyond the classroom, trauma from fleeing conflict, cultural adjustments, and language barriers. These challenges often result in feelings of alienation, with students forming groups based on shared languages and backgrounds, which limits interaction across the class. This division, especially the lack of Dutch practice, hinders both their social integration and academic progress.\n\nIn classrooms, students often avoid speaking Dutch, preferring to communicate in their native languages, which leads to exclusion of others, bullying, and weakened group dynamics. This makes it difficult for ISK students to feel connected and supported, impacting their well-being and learning experience.",
        result: "By incorporating teambuilding activities and gamified learning experiences, Quizzy helps students break out of their language-based friend groups, reduces conflicts, and creates a more unified and supportive classroom environment. It helps bridge the gap between students who may otherwise struggle to connect due to language barriers, encouraging them to communicate in Dutch and develop stronger social bonds.\n\nBy engaging students in group discussions and collaborative problem-solving, Quizzy helps students improve their Dutch language skills in a fun, non-intimidating way. The game includes two sets of cards, support cards and action cards. Support cards (Search, Wisdom, and Joker) provide versatile tools that aid in team strategy and communication. Action cards (Block, Target, and Shield) focus on direct interactions between teams, influencing the competitive dynamics of the game. These cards are designed with clear visual distinctions to ensure ease of use and understanding.",
